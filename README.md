# They Live... in the Cloud
### Welcome to the Dev Necropolis.

I'm @nakautot, a programmer who breathes life into dead code and haunts the GitHub graveyard.  Just kidding _(kind of)_.  Here to wrangle demons... I mean bugs... and build things that won't send you to the error log in the sky.

### Current Incantation _(Project)_:

**Pedagogue Support** - Conjuring up tools to enhance Preceptor performance. Be prepared for some dark magic _(and hopefully awesome results)_.

### My Unholy Skillset:

#### Spells _(Programming Languages)_:

- C# _(Charon#)_ 🐴
- Java _(JVM Necromancy)_ 🪄
- C++ _(Low-Level Demonic Rituals)_ 🔪
- Javascript _(Necroscript)_ 📜
- Nodejs _(HollowCore)_ 🪹
- Dead Codes _(python, c, vb, cf, etc.)_ 🤮

#### Augments _(Frameworks & Tools)_:
- React _(Lich React)_ ☠
- Angular _(Cursed Components)_ ⚙
- MSSQL _(NecronomiconDB)_ 📖
- MySQL _(PoltergeistDB)_ 👻
- NoSQL _(NecroVault)_ 🚪

#### Version Control:
- Github _(CryptKeeperCode)_ 💂‍♂️
- Gitlab _(The Bone Orchard)_ 🦴
- TFS _(The Spectral Forge)_ 🔨
- CVS _(The Repository of Shadows)_ ⚫

#### My Code Repositories:

[Project Name](link to repository): A [brief description of the project] that's more alive than it should be. ‍♂️
[Project Name](link to repository): Don't wake the code that lies dormant here...
(Feel free to add more project highlights with creepy descriptions)
Open Source Contributions (Optional):

### How to Reach Me (if You Dare):

(Optional) My personal website: [link to your website] (if it's not a creepy abandoned blog)
Let's chat on Twitter: [link to your Twitter profile] (if applicable)

### A Final Warning...

My code may be buggy, but it's definitely scary good.  Feel free to reach out if you need help necromancing some dead code or if you just enjoy a good scare _(and a good programmer)_.
